# PNG_Modifier
Wrote a class which can take in a .PNG file and make modify it according to the user. It uses HSLAPixel, PNG, RGB_HSL and lodepng classes that were given to me when I took datastructures.
# Instructions
You will need to install Clang and libc++ and the lib++abi: the Clang compiler and lib++ C++ standard library implementation.

Place the png file you wish to modify in the same folder as the code. When choosing which file to modify make sure to include the .png extension. The output file will be "new_" +filename.png and will be placed in the same folder.
